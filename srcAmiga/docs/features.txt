RayStorm V1.161
 
RayStorm is a new octreebased raytracer. It has been written to be as fast 
as possible. Thus we have implemented a octree algorithm, and optimized 
all calculations as much as we could.

Features

- Up to 30% faster than Imagine (in trace mode).
- ARexx-port. RayStorm can be used by all programs with ARexx-port.
- Imagine compatible. RayStorm is designed to be almost compatible to
  Imagine. It can load Imagine objects and use Imagine textures.
- Octree algorithm used for rendering.
- Color, reflectivity, filter, altitude and specular mapping.
- Flat, cylinder and sphere mapping.
- Soft brush mapping.
- Mathematical textures: wood, marble, bumps, checker, linear, stars.
- Tranparency and physically correct refractions.
- 8 levels of antialiasing (adaptive supersampling).
- Rendering box.
- Three builtin object types: sphere, plane and triangle.
- Three light types: ambient, point and spot.
- Depth of field with adjustable focal distance and aperture.
- Soft shadows.
- Backdrop picture.
- Global fog and foggy objects.
- Material attributes for realictic objects: ambient color, diffuse color,
  specular color, specular reflection exponent, diffuse transmission color,
  specular transmission color, specular transmission exponent, specular
  transmittance, transparent color, reflective color, index of refraction,
  foglength.
- Bright objects.
- Motion blur for realistic animations.
- Quick rendering.
- Global reflection map.
- Image formates: IFF-ILBM, PNG.
- Object format: Imagine-TDDD, Autodesk 3DS
- New image- and object-formats can be easily included because of the
  modular concept.
